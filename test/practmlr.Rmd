```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}

# 1. Load Data

```{r}
train <- read.csv("train_loan.csv", na.strings = c("", " ", NA))
test <- read.csv("test_loan.csv", na.strings = c("", " ", NA))
```

# 2. Exploring Data

```{r}
summarizeColumns(train)
```

```{r}
summarizeColumns(test)
```


```{r}
hist(train$ApplicantIncome, breaks = 300, main = "Applicant Income Chart", xlab = "Coapplicant Income")
```

```{r}
hist(train$CoapplicantIncome, breaks = 100, main = "Coapplicant Income Chart")
```

```{r}
boxplot(train$ApplicantIncome)
```

```{r}
boxplot(train$LoanAmount)
```

Changing to factor : Credit_History

```{r}
train$Credit_History <- as.factor(train$Credit_History)

test$Credit_History <- as.factor(test$Credit_History)

```

```{r}
class(train$Credit_History)
```

```{r}
summary(train)
summary(test)
```

```{r}
levels(train$Dependents)[4] <- "3"

levels(test$Dependents)[4] <- "3"
```
